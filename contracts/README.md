# AvaSend Smart Contracts

This directory contains the smart contracts for the AvaSend platform, a decentralized remittance dApp built on Avalanche.

## Contracts Overview

- `AvaSendCore.sol`: The main contract that handles USDC transfers and integrates with mobile money providers
- `VirtualCardManager.sol`: Manages the creation and handling of virtual debit cards
- `AvaSendFactory.sol`: Factory contract for deploying new instances of AvaSend
- `interfaces/`: Contains interface definitions for external contracts and services
- `libraries/`: Contains utility libraries used by the contracts

## Deployment

These contracts are designed to be deployed on the Avalanche C-Chain (both mainnet and Fuji testnet).

## Security

These contracts have been designed with security best practices in mind, but should undergo a professional audit before mainnet deployment.

Now, let's create the interface for the USDC token:

```solidity file="contracts/interfaces/IERC20.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

/**
 * @title IERC20
 * @dev Interface for the ERC20 standard token.
 */
interface IERC20 {
    /**
     * @dev Returns the amount of tokens in existence.
     */
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);

    /**
     * @dev Returns the amount of tokens owned by `account`.
     */
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);

    /**
     * @dev Moves `amount` tokens from the caller's account to `recipient`.
     *
     * Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
     *
     * Emits a {Transfer} event.
     */
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);

    /**
     * @dev Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` will be
     * allowed to spend on behalf of `owner` through {transferFrom}. This is
     * zero by default.
     *
     * This value changes when {approve} or {transferFrom} are called.
     */
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);

    /**
     * @dev Sets `amount` as the allowance of `spender` over the caller's tokens.
     *
     * Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
     *
     * IMPORTANT: Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk
     * that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate
     * transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this race
     * condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the
     * desired value afterwards:

     *

    /**

    function transferFrom(

        address recipient,
        uint256 amount
    ) external returns (bool);

    /**
     * @dev Emitted when `value` tokens are moved from one account (`from`) to
     * another (`to`).
     *
     * Note that `value` may be zero.
     */
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);

    /**
     * @dev Emitted when the allowance of a `spender` for an `owner` is set by
     * a call to {approve}. `value` is the new allowance.
